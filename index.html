      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Kosovo–Serbia conflict is one of the most complex legal and political disputes in Europe. It centers on Serbia’s claim to sovereignty over Kosovo and Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence, which over 100 countries have recognized. International law, NATO, and the EU have played major roles in addressing—but not fully resolving—the conflict.

    <section>
      <h2>Legal Framework: UN Security Council Resolution 1244</h2>
      <p>
        Resolution 1244 (1999) set the legal basis for UNMIK and NATO’s KFOR. It recognized Yugoslavia’s sovereignty while allowing autonomy for Kosovo, creating a legal ambiguity between territorial integrity and self-determination that remains unresolved.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Self-Determination vs. Territorial Integrity</h2>
      <p>
        International law supports both territorial integrity and peoples’ right to self-determination. Kosovo’s 2008 independence challenges Serbia’s borders but is justified by many due to past human rights abuses. This legal paradox lies at the core of the ongoing debate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ICJ Advisory Opinion (2010)</h2>
      <p>
        The International Court of Justice concluded that Kosovo’s declaration of independence did not violate international law. However, it did not endorse Kosovo’s right to secede, leaving the issues of recognition and sovereignty unresolved.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>NATO’s KFOR Mission</h2>
      <p>
        KFOR maintains peace in Kosovo under Resolution 1244. Yet, NATO’s 1999 intervention lacked Security Council approval, raising legal debates about humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty that continue today.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>European Union’s Role</h2>
      <p>
        The EU has mediated through the Brussels Agreement (2013), aiming to normalize relations without formal recognition. However, legal contradictions and non-binding frameworks challenge consistent implementation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ongoing Legal Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recognition and Statehood:</strong> Limited recognition blocks Kosovo from joining the UN.</li>
        <li><strong>Sovereignty vs. Self-Determination:</strong> Legal contradiction remains unresolved.</li>
        <li><strong>Legality of NATO's Intervention:</strong> Debate over humanitarian vs. unauthorized force.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation of Agreements:</strong> Agreements like Brussels lack legal enforceability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Kosovo–Serbia conflict underscores the limits of international law in resolving entrenched political disputes. Despite frameworks from the UN, NATO, and EU, unresolved issues of sovereignty and statehood persist, demanding creative legal and diplomatic approaches.
